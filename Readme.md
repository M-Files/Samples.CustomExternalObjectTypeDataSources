# Example M-Files Custom External Object Type Data Sources

This repository contains sample custom External Object Type Data Sources for use with M-Files.  The M-Files Developer Portal contains more details on [External Object Type Data Sources](https://developer.m-files.com/Built-In/External-Object-Type-Data-Source/), including custom ones.

There is currently one sample available.  This sample reads data from a set of `.json` files and can be used to create `User`, `Post` and `Comment` objects within M-Files.
